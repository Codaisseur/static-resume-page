### 🌟 HTML is the language of the web, used for writing web pages.

Any website you ever visited was made with html (Hyper Text Markup Language). The language started off as a pure text based document format, and each new version of HTML is adapted to the new requirements of the web. HTML is used to structure your content.

You can inspect the HTML code of any page you visit. Let's try with our  [example page](https://serene-mcnulty-aa84b3.netlify.com/)!


## ✏️ Exercise
> * Add the browser extension [mozilla X-ray goggles](https://goggles.mozilla.org/) in google chrome. Restart your browser.
> * Go to [ our example page](https://serene-mcnulty-aa84b3.netlify.com/).
> * Click on X-ray goggles in your bookmarks bar:
> ![x-ray-googles-button](https://cd.sseu.re/Jane_Doe_2018-09-05_16-43-11.png)
> * Click on 'Jane Doe', so this window will pop up:
> ![edit window](https://cd.sseu.re/Jane_Doe_2018-09-05_16-45-34.png)
> * Change 'Jane Doe'  into your own name.
> * Refresh the page. What happens?
> * Press `escape` to get out of the X-ray modus.


However our page is not just about structuring content. It is also about style! 

### 🌟 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language that describes the presentation of an HTML document, defining how elements must be rendered on screen, on paper, or in other media.

With CSS, you can control a lot of things related to how your page looks like:

+ color of the text
+ style of fonts
+ spacing between paragraphs
+ how columns are sized and laid out
+ what background images or colors are used
+ layout designs
+ variations in display for different devices and screen sizes
+ ...
