Our example website consists of different components:

It might help to think of these components as boxes:

* Our `body` (blue) consists of a `footer` and a `main` box (red)
* Inside our `main` box, there is a `side-bar` and a `more-info` box (orange)
* Inside our `more-info` box, there are a `work-experience` and a `education` box (yellow).
* Inside these boxes, there are even smaller boxes: the elements that we just learned about, such as `<h1>`, `<img>` and `spans`

In this section you will position these boxes in such a way that they look like an actual website!
